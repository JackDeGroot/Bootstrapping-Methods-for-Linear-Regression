<h1>Bootstrapping Methods for Linear Regression Simulations</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this project, I implemented four different bootstraping methods for linear regression from scratch and compared them using a simulation study. I evaluated the bootstrap methods based on their percentile bootstrap CIs for the slope in terms of both of coverage probabilities and the lengths of the CIs.
